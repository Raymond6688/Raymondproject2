# My explanations of two plots 
## plot 1
I created a grouped bar chart to analyze the number of students by level and their score. In the original dataset, the students are categorized to level 1, level 2, level 3 and level 4. They have different math  test scores. I counted the number of level 2 and level 3 students who got score of 4,5,6,7 in the dataset.
